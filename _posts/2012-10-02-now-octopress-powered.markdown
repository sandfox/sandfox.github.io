title: "Now Octopress Powered"

The more astute amongst you may have noticed the slight change in look and feel of my blog. After much faffing about with jekyll-bootstrap I've decided to upgrade/switch to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) with the [Slash](https://github.com/tommy351/Octopress-Theme-Slash) theme. I still have a lof of tinkering to do with the theme and layout. Unlike my switch to using Jekyll-bootstrap I'm not going to write any sort of guide as the [Octpress docs](http://octopress.org/docs/) are absolutely brilliant.
